description: Land a chosen set of the current repo's linked git worktrees into the default branch by rebase + fast-forward (never a merge commit), in a determined order, with confidence-gated conflict handling, post-land tests, exact-state rollback on failure, and scripted teardown. Use on /merge-worktrees or after /check-worktrees selects worktrees. Repo-scoped — never cross-repo.

# /merge-worktrees

Lands linked worktrees into the repo's **default branch** (`main` unless the repo's
`origin/HEAD` says otherwise) from the **primary checkout**, by **rebase + ff-merge** —
linear history, no merge commits. Every deterministic step is a `worktree_engine.py`
subcommand; you only fill the judgement gaps (conflict resolution, ordering, test-failure
decisions). Repo-scoped: only ever this repo's worktrees.

`ENGINE=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/worktree_engine.py`, `REPO=<primary checkout path>`,
`TARGET=<default branch>`. Engine exit codes: `0` ok · `10` n/a (already merged / on target)
· `11` worktree dirty · `12` primary unsafe · `13` rebase conflict (LEFT IN PROGRESS) ·
`14` ff-merge failed · `15` git error · `17` core.bare corruption.

**Safety contract:**
- **No blanket per-merge approval.** The 99% case (clean, chronological) just lands. HITL is
  reached only via the confidence-gated escalation below.
- **Rollback uses scoped `git reset --hard`** via the engine `undo` — AUTHORIZED here only,
  and only safe because we commit everything and snapshot *after* the last commit (no
  uncommitted tracked work exists; `--hard` never touches untracked files). Mid-rebase
  conflicts use the engine's own abort, never a reset.
- Respect the active project's CLAUDE.md (e.g. TACO SSH-approval gates).

## Inputs
Chosen worktrees as `path` + `branch` pairs (from `/check-worktrees`), **or** a single
`--worktree <path>` (from `/rmws`). If invoked bare, run
`python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check_worktrees.py --json` and do the
`/check-worktrees` selection first.

Confirm you are in the **primary checkout** (`git -C <cwd> rev-parse --git-dir` → `.git`).
If inside a linked worktree, `ExitWorktree(action:"keep")` first. Resolve `TARGET` from
`git -C $REPO symbolic-ref --quiet refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (leaf), else `main`.

## 1. Commit dirty worktrees (one at a time)
For each chosen worktree that is dirty: show `git -C <path> status` + `diff --stat`;
`AskUserQuestion` "commit these in `<branch>`?".
- **Yes** → `EnterWorktree(path:<path>)` → `/commit-commands:commitall` (fix review /
  pre-commit issues as normal) → `ExitWorktree(action:"keep")`.
- **No** → drop from the set; note it. Repeat until all remaining are clean.

## 2. Snapshot the restore anchors
After all commits, before any rebase:
`python3 $ENGINE --repo $REPO snapshot --target $TARGET --branches <b1,b2,…>`
Save `details.target_sha` and `details.branch_shas` — this is the exact pre-land state
`undo` restores to. **Re-run snapshot** if step 1 produced further commits.

## 3. Determine land order
Order by: dir mtime (chronological; older first is the safe default), project state / recent
`$TARGET` commits, and each worktree's commit content. Order matters under rebase — later
worktrees rebase onto earlier ones. Confidence-gated:
- low/medium → **advisor**; still low/medium → `/tao:thinkdeep` + `/tao:chat` + `/think` +
  `/tao:consensus` + `/tao:vet` + `/tao:synthesize`; still low/medium → **pause**,
  `AskUserQuestion` explaining the conundrum in plain terms (summarize; no internal
  step/option names), recommend a path with rationale. The clear case skips all of this.

## 4. Race re-check (per worktree, just before its land)
Re-run `claude agents --json`. If the only session inside this worktree is **this** session,
`ExitWorktree(action:"keep")` and re-check. If **another** session occupies it → skip +
pause + explain.

## 5. Land in order
For each branch in order:
`python3 $ENGINE --repo $REPO land --worktree <path> --branch <branch> --target $TARGET`
- `0` → landed; next worktree (each subsequent rebases onto the now-advanced `$TARGET`).
- `13` (conflict, rebase LEFT IN PROGRESS) → resolve the listed `details.conflicts` in the
  worktree. High-confidence resolution → just do it. Low/medium (e.g. `foo(argA)`+`foo(argB)`
  → `foo(argA,argB)` + a combined test) → run the **step-3 escalation ladder**. Then
  `git -C <path> add <files>` and
  `python3 $ENGINE --repo $REPO rebase-continue --worktree <path> --branch <branch> --target $TARGET`;
  loop on repeated `13`.
- `10` → already merged; skip to teardown for it. `11`/`12`/`14`/`15`/`17` → stop, report
  `message` verbatim (these are preflight/safety refusals, not things to force).

## 6. Verify + test (ALWAYS, after all lands)
`git -C $REPO log --oneline -n 20` and `git -C $REPO status --porcelain` (expect clean +
expected commits). Then run the suite: Justfile `test` (`just test`) → `npm test` (if
`package.json`) → `pytest` (if Python) → `cargo test` (if Cargo) → else ask.
- **Pass** → step 7.
- **Verify wrong, or unexpected test failures:**
  - trivial + clear + high-confidence fix → fix it, re-verify.
  - else → **roll back**:
    `python3 $ENGINE --repo $REPO undo --target $TARGET --target-sha <snap.target_sha> --branch-shas <b1=sha1> <b2=sha2> …`
    then advisor + escalation, and `AskUserQuestion` with four paths: **b.1** apply suggested
    fixes (rationale + confidence) and retry from step 5; **b.2** undo + retry the
    escalate-land loop (max **3 rounds**, then post-mortem); **b.3** abandon — leave undone
    (original state); **b.4** abandon but leave the current (landed) state, and hand the user
    the exact `undo` command to roll back later. After 3 failed rounds: stop + post-mortem
    (what was tried / what happened / best explanation / next steps).

## 7. Teardown (only on green: verify clean AND tests pass)
For each successfully landed worktree:
`python3 $ENGINE --repo $REPO teardown --branch <branch> --target $TARGET`
`0` = pruned/no-op; non-zero = refused (report verbatim, never force).

## 8. Summary
Which worktrees landed and in what order, any dropped/skipped + why, conflicts resolved,
test result, what was pruned, and the final `$TARGET` state.
