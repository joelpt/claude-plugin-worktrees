"""SessionStart hook: surface this repo's git worktrees and inject enforcement context.

Fires only for startup/resume (enforced by hooks.json matchers; re-checked
defensively here). Two preconditions always hold before anything is output:
cwd is inside a git repo, and cwd is the repo's MAIN worktree (never a linked
worktree).

Outputs up to two JSON fields:

  ``systemMessage`` (user-facing banner, not injected into agent context):
    Governed by the ``startup_display`` setting — "always" (default), "mergeable",
    or "never". Shows a category breakdown and the worktree table.

  ``additionalInformation`` (injected into agent context):
    Present only when the worktree-first enforcement gate is active. Contains
    a MANDATORY directive instructing the agent to call EnterWorktree before
    any Edit or Write operation.

Exit code is always 0 — a failing SessionStart hook degrades every user session.
